#### `public  `[`Walrus`](#classWalrus_1a75c3d200b57a5c9fbcef9d8dc8247bf3)`()` 

Instantiate [Walrus](#classWalrus) object.

#### `public uint8_t `[`begin`](#classWalrus_1ac59951e00938de0d6fa86a4e739950a1)`(uint8_t Address_)` 

Begin communications with the [Walrus](#classWalrus) using a prescribed address.

#### Parameters
* `Address_` I2C address of [Walrus](#classWalrus) DOES NOT YET USE A VARIABLE ADDRESS! THIS DEFAULT ADDRESS CURRENTLY CLASHES WITH HAAR'S DEFAULT!

#### `public float `[`getTemperature`](#classWalrus_1a85ce9dfa9cfb381a7d9a15eb0ce928d3)`(uint8_t Location)` 

Return calculated temperature from [Walrus](#classWalrus).

This calculated temperature can be from either the MS5803 sensor, which primarily measures pressure, or from the

#### Parameters
* `Location` TEMP_REG_0: Read dedicated temperature sensor. TEMP_REG_1: Read temperature sensor withn the MS5803. APPEARS TO JUST WORK WIHT TEMP_REG_0 FOR NOW

#### `public float `[`getTemperature`](#classWalrus_1a18b8301db55eae06af23ee572d9b5c96)`()` 

Return calculated temperature from sensor, using a predefined offset. WHAT DOES THIS OFFSET DO?

#### `public float `[`getPressure`](#classWalrus_1a133a8b6e4e425c4b3bb6c7863607cae9)`()` 

Return calculated pressure from sensor.

This is the MS5803 sensor, which can come in a variety of different pressure ranges and sensitivities.

#### `public String `[`GetHeader`](#classWalrus_1a17341827680ca67f02885219f00d9326)`()` 

Return header.

"Pressure [mBar],Temp DH [C],Temp DHt [C],"

#### `public String `[`GetString`](#classWalrus_1a5442e6ca8a93db0e65fe9a72df5d7b23)`()` 

Return measurement data as a string.

String(getPressure()) + "," + String(getTemperature(0))

* "," + String(getTemperature(1)) + ",";
